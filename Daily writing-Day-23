Javascript:

  In this day my mentor thaught me Javascript, in javascript she thaught me about two topics  one is array and the another 
one is object.Array is a single variable that is used to store different elements.it is often used whwn we want to store 
list of elements and access them by a single variable.unlike most languages where array ia reference to the multiple variable,
in javascript  array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.array in javascript  are indexed from 0 so we can access
elements from 0 and by the number.The array paramater is a list of strings  or integers.

 The second one is object. object is an un ordered collection of key-value pairs.Each key value pair is called a property.
The key of a property can be string and the value of a property can be any valid javascript value eg.,a string,a number,
an array and even a function.When a function is a property of an object,it's often called a method.javascript provides you
with many ways to create a new object.The most popular one is to use the object literal syntax.To create an object with
properties,you use the key:value within the curly braces.To access a property of an object,you use one of two notations:
the dot notation and array like notation.1) The dot Notation Objectname:propertyName this illustrates how to use the dot
notation to access a property of an object and the second one is array like notation  objectname:['propertyname'] this 
illustrates how to access the value of an object's property via the array-like notation.To delete a property of an object,
you use the delete operator.
