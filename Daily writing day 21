Food Website
       Iam designing the food website using html and css in that website i have inserted the pictures for all locations 
and given name for all the foods and given the cost of food for all the foods in that i have learned the new htnl
code called <span> this span tag is an lnline container is used to markup a text or a part of a document.The<span> 
tag is easily styled by css or manipulated with javascript using the class or attribute.The <span> tag is much like 
that <div> element,but <div> is block level element and <span> is an inline element.such that i inserted the names for
all the pictures and the cost of the pictures.

Class with Abraham anna
   After that we had a meeting with abraham anna in that meeting meeting he thaught us javascript.He taught us primitive 
types they are string literal,number,boolean,null then if the words is in double coats "hello" it is string and then 
composite types they are object,array,function,and then he taught about let and variable and explaine us about how it
works and what is it for.

     After that my mentor starts tecahing Javascript.Javascript is a programming language not a scripting language 
The variables name starts with alphabets a-z,A-Z,$,_ .And then let and constants are declaration of variables.
And then she teach us about operators there are five operators they are Arithmatic operators,Realtional operators,
Assignment operators,Logical operators,Increment and decrement operators.first the arithmatic operators the 
Arithmatic operators are +(plus)-(minus)*(multiplication)/(division)%(module).Then the Assignment operators is 
=(equal to). And then Logical operators are And or not equal to and not equal to.this is thje first day i started 
learning javascript.by the day ends well.
