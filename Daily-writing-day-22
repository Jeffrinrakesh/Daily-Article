Food Website:
  In this day i have designed the food website design for all locations and entered the available foods in the 
Restaurants and inserted the pictures of the available foods in the restaurants and entered the price of the 
food in that restaurant.The name of the food is placed below the picture of the food.The food is arranged 
vertically to each other.

Meeting with abraham anna:
  In this meeting anna thought us about the Object and arrays in Javascript.object is the standalone entity
that holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods.object properties stores a literal value and
method represents function.An object can be created using object literal or object constructor syntax and 
array is the single variable unlike most languages where ay is a reference to the multiple variable.in Javascript
array is a single varialble that stores multiple elements. This is very new to me because i don't have any prior
knowledge about programming and this is the first time that i came to know what is javascript.Iam very excited 
to learn the new language,BUt it is some what hard for me because i don't have any basics of programming language,
but i tried to learn the programming.now i got a hope that i can learn the programmimg.

Javascript
 Then my mentor started  teaching me a Javascript first she taught about the increment and decrement operators.
increment and decrement operators means ++ and -- and then she thaught us about the conditional statements 
1) if 2)if else 3)else if 4)switch.These conditional statements will run by relational operators. then she 
gave me four questions to solve first one is greatest of two numbers and the second one is greatest of three 
numbers and the third one is lowest of two numbers and  the fourth one is lowest of three numbers i started 
solving these problems  in my own way i had many mistakes and my mentor asked me to think what mistakes you 
have done and what are the changes you should do.then i started thinking about what mistakes i have done 
and what are the changes i should do.but i didn't get it because i don't have base of programmimg language
then at one point of time my mentor gave me some guidance and then i found what mistakes i have done in that 
then i cleared my mistakes.by the day ends well.
