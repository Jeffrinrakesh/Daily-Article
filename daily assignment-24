   In this day i have learned loops and fuctions in javascript and i learned data models and JSON. 

Loops:
  In very first morning first i have been taught by loop, loop executes block of code as long as a specific condition is true.
In javascript loops are taken as in three arguments:Initialization,Condition,and Increment...Loops repeat the same block of
code until a certain condition is met. They are useful for many repetitive programming tasks.in loops i have studied two 
types of loops one is for loop and another is while loop.In javascript for loop executes a block of code as long as a specified 
condition is true,Javascript for loops takes three aarguments:initialization,condition and increment.loops repeat the same 
block of code until a certain condition is met.example for for loop is if we want to check the grade of every student in 
the class,we loop from 1 to that number.then i have learned while loop in javascript while loop executes block of code while
a condition eveluates to true.while loop stop executingwhwn their condition evaluates to false.A while loop lets you repeat
a block of code multiple times.this is what i learned in loops in this day 

Functions:
  A function in javascript is similar to a procedure, a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value ,
but for a procedure to qualify a sa function,it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious 
relationship between the input and the output.there are two advantages of javascript functions.1) code reusability:we can
call a function several times so it save coding.2)Less coding:it makes our program compact.we don't need to write many 
lines of code each time to perform a common task.

Data modelling:
  Data modelling is a process of creating a simple diagram of a complex software system,using text and symbols to represent
the way the data will flow. the diagram can be used to ensure efficient use of data as a blueprint for the construction of
new software.

JSON:
  In,Json data is represented in key-value pairs,and curly braces hold objects,where a colon is followed after each time.
The comma is used to seperate a key value pairs.square brackets are used to hold arrays,where each value is comma seperated.

Demo meeting:
  After that at evening demo meeting starts and every one started explaining about what they have done and what they are
going to do one by one by team all are explained and after we interns got a chance to explain that what we have done in this 
week.
