      This is our 10 th day, we interns came to surfboard office with more expectations to learn and gain our knowledge
and to develop our skills ,At very first morning after breakfast i started to practice a designs related to html and css.
I practiced many problems, i understood that by solving many problems we can gain many knowledge and can increase the speed 
to solve problems.Iam really happy to say that i have learned the basics of the designs.

  After that my mentor reviewed my homework and given me a login page design to do.i started designing the problem
after i started to solve i found that i has many doubts in the problem. I searched in google to find the tags to
solve problems.I asked doubts to my mentor,My mentor asked me to search in google and to find the answer I started 
searching in google finally i got some ideas then i went to my my mentor,My mentor reviewed my answers and she found
some mistakes in that answer so she returned me back to find out the correct answer,Finally after a great battle 
with the help of my mentor i completed the problem

Then we has a meeting with sri ram anna in that meeting he solved the probllem and shown us the answer for tom and 
jerry problem and table problem and                       problem.he explained us clearly so that we under stood 
the problem. 

   After the meeting i started coding the html and css to learn someting new i found there are lot of things which
   i have to learn and to gain knowledge. i learned some thing new and implemented in coding.
   
   then my mentor taught us a html, she teached about the tags that we use like <p>tag,<br>tag,<li> tags,<b> tag,<i> tags
   etc and she started teaching how to implement them in the code and how it is framed and she showed how it works. i 
   learned many things in html 
   
 I found people in the surfboard are very friendly and open to all and they are very friendly to others . Surfboard is 
 one of the best place to work where there is no pressure in work and can work with out any pressure. and by evening 
 its heavy rain outside we havea issues in facing power cut for sometime in office.by the day ends well
