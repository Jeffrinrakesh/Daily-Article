                                                      Daily Writing-Day-13

  This is our 13th day we interns came to surfboard office with more expectations and to gain knowledge and to develop our skills. At very first 
morning after breakfast i started practicing the html and css design that was given to my mentor before day in that i learned some new codes 
overflow-y:hidden and overflow-x:hidden these commands are used to scroll the pages i used these commands to that design 

    After that design i started to learn SDLC means Softeare development life cycle .It is a structured process that enables the production of high
quality and low cost software,in the shortest possible production time .the goal of SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds 
all customer expectations adn demands this is the new thing which i learned and then i learned why SDLC is importatnt,

                       *)It provides standardized framework that defines activities and deliverables,
                       *)It aids in project planning,estimating and scheduling.
                       *)It makes project tracking and control easier
                       *)It increase the speed of development
                       *)It increases client relations 
                       *)It Decreses project risk
                       *)Decreses project management expence the overall cost of production.
                       
And then i learned how does SDLC works it has many phases like planning phase,cooling phase,Building phase,testing phase,release phase,
Deploy phase,operate phase,Monitor phase. In planning phase encompases all aspects of project and product management. This includes 
capacity planning,project scheduling,cost estimation and provisioning.And then in cooling phase it includes system design in an integrated 
development environment.It also include static code analysis and code review for multiple type of devices and then in Building phase it 
takes the code requirements determines earlier and uses those to begin actually building a software and then testing phase.This phase entails 
the evaluation of the software and then release phase the release phase involves the team packaging, managing and deploying releases across 
different environment, and then deploy phase, In the deploy phase software is oficially released in to the production environment.And then
operate phase.The operate phase entails the use of the software in the production environment.And then monitor phase,In this phase various
elements of the softwares are monitored.This could include all over the system performance.

 After that the cultural talks was taken by Abraham anna and in this meeting He had explained about the cultures and we had a discussion 
about obligation,Responsibility,Duty,Darma.So we started discussing about these topics by spliting the team,Jerfin,Abin,joshua,and me are 
joined as a team and started discussing about these topics and we cam in to a conclusion with a certain points.then anna asked to explain 
what we had discussed,But unfortunately we didn't get a chance to expain our thoughts.And after explaning the cultural talks came to an end.

 After the cultural talks I started preparing for my presentation in the topic named Cloud Computing in that preparation jerfin anna 
helped me to prepare about cloud and i gathered some knowlwdge from jerfin anna by the preparation i came to know something about cloud
by the day ends well.
