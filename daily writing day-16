                                                       Daily Writing Day-16
                                                       
 In this day i continued the food website design today i started inserting the pictures for main page and and for side scrollable page after that
my mentor started reviewing my home works and started reading the daily writings and she explained me that what are the corrections that i have 
to be do so that i done the corrections and then i started design work then i inserted a tag text-decoration-none this is one of the complecated
design that i have designed ever.

 After that we had a meeting with abraham anna in that meeting he started explaining data to us in that he explained as there are use less data  and
Data that is the part of algorithm,Data that provides contaxt of algorithm and then he explained about the Types of data. There are three types of
data string literature,number literature,Boolean sp the string litereture means the alpha numeric symbols to operators and the number literatiure
means [0-9.,]and the Boolean means True or false after he told about abstract he told us one example ofnthe room the available items in room like
switches,sockets,light,table ,chari etc..then he explained us about the sound travel inside the room and absotbtion of sound inside the room,means
the sound absorbtion like curtions are available in that room.and he gave us a task to do.

 The task is go to the lift that availabe in outside of the office and wirite about the abstraction,So we interns went to the lift and started
abosrving the lift moments that goes up and down and we travelled in the lift and started absorving the moments and how it works and we noted 
the available buttons and availabe parts in the lift and then we came to a conclusion and then we started weiting about that in the note book 
as abraham anna instructed us.in the i wrote the working process of lift that the lift moves up and down.  if i standing in the second floor 
and the lift is now in fourth floor if i press the button the lift comes from fourth floor and opens in the second floor and if we press button
for fourth and first foor the lift goes to fourth floor first and then it goes to the first floor that means the priority first and we noticed 
that once the maximum weight of people reaches the lift it alarams the sound.

 Then we are advised to install a reducated app by koushik he send us a link to install the app and i installed the app this app was not in 
play store thats y koushik send us a link and after inatlled app i see all the people in the surfboard are in that app this app is like 
communication app where we can text each other and  share the home works and  the mentors can also give us a home by this app.i think this
will be very useful for us.

 After completion of installing the app i started designing the food webiste in that i have learnd how to aplly background image and how
place the button in the center and how to blur the background og the button for this i have used opacity and hoe the change the font size
and colour and then i learned to give the colour by giving the colour code and i learned to give background clour by rgb for example
rgb(0,0,0,0.3).So thats all i learned this day.
