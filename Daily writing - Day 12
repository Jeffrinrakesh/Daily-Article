   This is our 12th day we interns came to surfboard office with more expectations and to learn and develop our skills.
at very first morning after breakfast I started learning some new css codes in justify content like justify-content: space-between;
like justify content:start,justify:content-center,justify-content:space-between,justify-content:space-around,justify-content:space-evenly;
and i learned in aligned-items like align-item:stretch,align-item:center,align-item:start,align-item:end, and i learned 
flex-directions like flex-direction:row,flex-direction:row-reverse;flex-direction:colomn,flex-direction:colum-reverse and so on
iam very intrested to learn new codes because the more i learn i code easily and shortly 

  After that my mentor reviewed my homework and then she gave me a problem to solve it was a very challenging problem .In that 
i started breakdown the problem and started thinking how to solve the problem and how to execute.After sometimes i got a slight
idea how to solve a problem in that way i started solving the problem and i made some mistakes there and i was guided by my mentor
then i got some idea how to solve the problem  

  After that i had a meeting with koushik,In that meeting koushik teached us an algorithm and how it is used and how to write it.
  
  After that i started doing designing problems which was given by my mentor. i started doing that problem it was a big problem
which i have to think very much to sove that problem i took more time to solvee that problem and i have doubts in that problem 
and it was clarified by my mentor 

  Then we had a session with sriram anna, In that session he taught us how to open git account, So first we we want to create 
new account using core illustrio mailid after that we want to create a new repository after that create the repository name as 
core illustrio internship after that choose git must be in public or private,we are advaised to keep in public mode and then 
add readme it is optional one.Then create a seperate folder and in that folder make the files name as projects,weekely assignments

  After that meeting my mentor asked me what you guys taught in the meeting so i have explained what we have taught in that meeting

  I found that surfboard employees are very friendly and easily attachable to us, so whatever the doubts that we ask to them explain
us very clearly, I like the work environment in the surfboard office and by the day ends well.
