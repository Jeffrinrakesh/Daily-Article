 Then we had a meeting with abraham anna started teaching us about programing languages and by continuous teaching he went in
to the electronics topic and teached us about diodes transistors and he teached us about atoms, covalent bonds etc...
and he told that there are two types of algorithm they are sorting and search algorithm and then he advaisesd us to read 
about Registers,Multiplexes, gates and address.and he teached us about npn transistors and pnp transistors and he told 
us that from next week he will trach how to create a programming language and he will teach one programing language 
Javascript.

  And then i started to design food website and i had some doubts in that my mentor explained me about that doubt and 
i done corrections that what mistakes i have done.i learned new html tag today that is mark tag <mark>.so this tag is 
for making text background yellow and the text colour is black the colour is the default colour for the mark tag we 
can not insert any other colour for that tag.And i learned clearly how hover works and i also learned clearly how 
opacity works.

 Then the cluture talks was conducted by abraham anna in that he asked to explain about responsibility,obligation,
duty,dharma what we have discussed as a team that before week.So one by each team started explaining about what they 
learned. so finally anna clearly explained that responsibility means that is all about that person.any given many
examples for that and then he explained about obligation and he explained about duty and then he expalined about 
dharma as well so i learned more new things which i ever heard before and some of them are taking notes for this 
all are keenily listening to anna that what he is saying.And after cluture talks my mentor gave me some guidance 
regarding the food website that next what should i do.so by the day ends well.
